## THESE CODES MAINLY USE FOR CALCULATE UNIT HYDROGRAPH


## 1.unitHydrograph.m

This .m file is a script based on Matlab for obtain Unit Hydrograph.
See the whole file and try run it.

## 2.Nakayasu_UH.m

This .m file is a script based on Matlab for obtain Unit Hydrograph using Nakayasu method.

## 3. Test.py

This .py file is a script about LSTM networks.
It mainlu uses these modules:
```
import numpy as np
import torch
from torch import nn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
Download and run it, you will get a nice train img!

# Project Overview

PyFlo is an open-source library written in Python for performing hydraulic and hydrology stormwater
analysis. Capabilities include network hydraulic grade analysis and time/iteration based storage and
flood routing simulations. SCS Unit Hydrograph and Rational Method are included for basin
computations. Most of the calculations and procedures are derived from available existing
publications and resources. There are some GUI programs available that have similar capabilities.
The intent is that many will build from and contribute to the project, making it much more powerful
than a single person ever could.

# Installation

Installing the easy way, using pip:

```bash
$ pip install pyflo
```

# Examples

## Hydrographs

From [NEH Hydrology Ch. 16, Ex. 16-1](http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/ftpref/wntsc/H&H/NEHhydrology/ch16.pdf#page=15):

```python
from pyflo import system
from pyflo.nrcs import hydrology

uh484 = system.array_from_csv('./resources/distributions/runoff/scs484.csv')
basin = hydrology.Basin(
area=4.6,
cn=85.0,
tc=2.3,
runoff_dist=uh484,
peak_factor=484.0
)
```
### Unit Hydrograph

With PyFlo, it's fairly simple to create a unit hydrograph, which represents the time-flow
relationship per unit (inch) of runoff depth.

```python
unit_hydrograph = basin.unit_hydrograph(interval=0.3)
```

We can use `matplotlib` to plot the example results:

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot

x = unit_hydrograph[:, 0]
y = unit_hydrograph[:, 1]
pyplot.plot(x, y, 'k')
pyplot.plot(x, y, 'bo')
pyplot.title(r'Unit Hydrograph from Example 16-1')
pyplot.xlabel(r'Time ($hr$)')
pyplot.ylabel(r'Discharge ($\frac{ft^{3}}{s}$)')
pyplot.show()
```

### Flood Hydrograph

A flood hydrograph can be generated, which is a time-flow relationship synthesized from basin
properties and a provided scaled rainfall distribution.

```python
import numpy

rainfall_dist = numpy.array([
(0.00, 0.000),
(0.05, 0.074),
(0.10, 0.174),
(0.15, 0.280),
(0.20, 0.378),
(0.25, 0.448),
(0.30, 0.496),
(0.35, 0.526),
(0.40, 0.540),
(0.45, 0.540),
(0.50, 0.540),
(0.55, 0.542),
(0.60, 0.554),
(0.65, 0.582),
(0.70, 0.640),
(0.75, 0.724),
(0.80, 0.816),
(0.85, 0.886),
(0.90, 0.940),
(0.95, 0.980),
(1.00, 1.000)
])
rainfall_depths = rainfall_dist * [6.0, 5.0] # Scale array to 5 inches over 6 hours.
flood_hydrograph = basin.flood_hydrograph(rainfall_depths, interval=0.3)
```

We can use `matplotlib` to plot the example results:

```python
from matplotlib import pyplot

x = flood_hydrograph[:, 0]
y = flood_hydrograph[:, 1]
pyplot.plot(x, y, 'k')
pyplot.plot(x, y, 'bo')
pyplot.title(r'Flood Hydrograph from Example 16-1')
pyplot.xlabel(r'Time ($hr$)')
pyplot.ylabel(r'Discharge ($\frac{ft^{3}}{s}$)')
pyplot.show()
```
