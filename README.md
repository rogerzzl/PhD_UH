## THESE CODES MAINLY USE FOR CALCULATE UNIT HYDROGRAPH


## 1.unitHydrograph.m

This .m file is a script based on Matlab for obtain Unit Hydrograph.
See the whole file and try run it.

## 2.Nakayasu_UH.m

This .m file is a script based on Matlab for obtain Unit Hydrograph using Nakayasu method.

## 3. Test.py

This .py file is a script about LSTM networks.
It mainlu uses these modules:
```
import numpy as np
import torch
from torch import nn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
Download and run it, you will get a nice train img!

## 4. Unit Hydrograph
